  		<div class="description">The Welsh Corgi is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund. A certain degree of interbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the similarities between the two.</div>

<!-- summury. CSS is a code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. To include CSS style we can use 3 methods: 1. Write CSS in the <head> od HTML. 2. Link HTML to a separate CSS file. 3. Write your style inline with HTML.

To deal with box-sizing issues: 1. Set size in terms of % rather then px. 
2. Set the 'box-sizing' attribute to 'border-box' for every element.

Box positioning: 1. DIVs are block elements, so by default they take up the entire width of a page. 2. Adding the rule 'display:flex;' will override this behavior and let DIVs appear next to each other. -->
